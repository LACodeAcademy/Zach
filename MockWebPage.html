			<p>He has also known to be able to cure the sick by just being in their presence.</p>
			<p>Now it's time to create a mini "site".<p>
			<ul>
				<li>This is a decent sized project that will take more than 5min. So it would be a good idea to create a branch of this code. If you make a major screw up, no harm, we can abandon the branch and easily return to the master (aka trunk).</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Go into source tree, click <b>master</b>.</li>
						<li>On the top bar click "branch".</li>
						<li>In the "New Branch" box give it a logical name. Something like "feature/ZP-CreateIntoSite". This name will put it into a folder called "feature", preceeds the name with your initials so I know who's working on it, and also gives it a name so it's easily identifiable.</li>
						<li>After you "Create Branch" you will notice that "master" is no longer bolded and now your new branch is. This indicates that you are working in your new branch. All changes and commits push to whatever is bolded. The master stays the same.</li>
						<li>It is worth noting that I won't see any branches you create until you do a push of the branch.</li>
						<li>It is also worth noting that all changes should be committed before you switch from one branch to another (you dont necessarily have to do a push, though. Just a commit).</li>
					</ul>
				<li>Alright, regular guy with a big dick, you have a branch. Now to start work on your new site. All work should be done in the branch.</li>
				<li>Create a page for each player. Give them logical names like loren.html and zach.html.</li>
				<li>Each page should have a short bio.</li>
				<li><b>Stop all work and message Loren. Don't proceed working until he responds.</b></li>
				<li>The menu on each page should have a link to each of the other pages.</li>
				<li>You styles will be shared by all of these pages. You can copy/paste them to each page or you can one-up yourself by created a new files called styles.css, copy the styles to that file, then reference the file in the head of each page.</li>
				<li>You will need an image of each player. Because that can get messy in your with all the diff files it would probably be a good idea to create a new folder called "mugshots" and put the images in that. Then when referencing you do img src="mugshots/zach.jpg".</li>
