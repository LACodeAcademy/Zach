		<p style="text-align: center;">Hello <strong>WORLD!</strong></p>
		<br/>
		<p style="font-size: 200%; text-align: center;">This is my very first HTML page.</p>
		<br/>
		<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 150%; font-weight: bold;">I learned how to do this<a href="http://www.htmlgoodies.com/primers/html/article.php/3478131#"> here</a></p>
		
		<div style="margin:10px auto; border:1px solid black; width:400px;">
		  <p>Now do some research on divs. Div is short for "division" and it's how you split your page up into different sections. The header is in a div, the menu is a separate div, and the main section is also a div.</p>
		  Experiment with
		  <ul>
			<li>Lists</li>
			<li>Tables</li>
			<li>Divs</li>
			<li>More styles - Margins, padding, alignment. You should be able to have a div expand the full page. Google search "css box diagram".</li>			
		  </ul>
		  <p>Also, research how to put all of your css styling into the head section of the html page (called "embedded"). So far you've donw what is called "inline" css. 
		</div>
		
		<div style="float:left; min-height:300px; width:300px; border:1px solid black;">
		left div
		<br /><br />
		a menu could go here.
		</div>
		<div style=" min-height:300px; width:300px; margin-left:350px; border:1px solid black;">
		div next to left div
		<br /><br />
		This could be a little "widget" box which holds a twitter feed.

		<h2>Fuck Ya!</h2>
		<p class="LorenStyle">This morning I did a pull and saw your changes, which were expected. Good! Experiment and dick around with the items in the list above. Also notice that I added some embedded styling in the header for this tag. This single tag can be styled from several different places. Inline (when the tag is started), embedded (top of page), and external (a seperate file that he page references in the head).</p>
		<p>Also note that this is all done by memory. You don't have to be an expert, but this basic syntax and all of the tags should be pretty easy to you.</p>

			Looks good! The default table borders are annoying AF. There's hack use can do to make simple borders.

			<p>It is good practice to put all of your standard elements on the page (divs, h1, text, etc) then have an embedded style sheet at the top of the page to do the styling. The reason is because later on when your boss says, "I want all tables to have a red background" you can alter code in one place in the heading and all tables on the page change color. It is really crazy what you can do with CSS. There's a website called csszengarden.com. Go there. What they do is provide web developers with a basic html page. The developers can't alter any of the html. All the developer does is create a CSS sheet which styles the html. So on the page there are links on the right side. Every link is to a different developer's page. The html is exactly the same on ALL pages, the only difference is the css which completely makes the page look different. Same content, different style.</p>
